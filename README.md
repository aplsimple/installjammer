# What's that

 It's a bit modified [installjammer](https://github.com/damoncourtney/installjammer) project, regretfully not maintained now.

# Changes

 The changes are:

 - changing colors in *Themes/Modern_Wizard/Common* files

 - commenting out *tk_setPalette* line in *gui-unix.tcl*

 - [alited.mpi](https://github.com/aplsimple/alited/releases/tag/install-alited-v1.6) (for Linux) is added to *tests*, just to share

 These changes make the [installjammer](https://github.com/aplsimple/installjammer) to be more usable in the dark themed KDE (otherwise not usable at all).

 Still, even more important is that the resulting installers look fine in the dark themed KDE.
